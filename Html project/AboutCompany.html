In 1948, Polaroid introduced its first consumer camera. The Land Camera Model 95 was the first camera to use
        instant film to quickly produce photographs without developing them in a laboratory. The popular Model 95 and
        subsequent Land Cameras required complex procedures to take and produce good photographs. Photographic paper had
        to be manually removed from cameras, peeled open after 60 seconds, needed several minutes to dry, and often left
        developing chemicals on hands. The instructions for the Model 20 Swinger, introduced in 1965, warned that, if
        not followed, "youâ€™re headed for plenty of picture taking trouble".      </p>

         The SX-70 included many sophisticated design elements. A collapsible SLR required a complex light path for the
        viewfinder, with three mirrors (including one Fresnel reflector) of unusual, aspheric shapes set at odd angles
        to create an erect image on the film and an erect aerial image for the viewfinder.Many mechanical parts were
        precision plastic moldings. The body was made of glass-filled polysulfone, a rigid plastic which was plated with
        a thin layer of copper-nickel-chromium alloy to give a metallic appearance. Models 2 & 3 used ABS in either
        Ebony or Ivory color. The film pack contained a flat, 6-volt "PolaPulse" battery to power the camera
        electronics, drive motor and flash.The original flash system, a disposable "Flash Bar" consisting of 10 bulbs
        (five on each side, with the user rotating the bar halfway through) from General Electric, used logic circuits
        to detect and fire the next unused flash.
